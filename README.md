# BTLO(Blue Team Labs Online) Investigations

## About
This repository is a record of my ongoing progress through various Investigations within BTLO. 
In this project, I get to utilize and become familiar with a variety of industry-standard tools through simulated realistic security events, gaining practice with threat detection, analysis, and response.

## Tools Used (this will be updated)
- Splunk
  
## Structure
Each investigation has its own setup with notes and questions provided. 
Pictures for each investigation will be added for each one for clarity.

## Contact
Please feel free to reach out with any questions, suggestions, comments, or just to follow my journey!
