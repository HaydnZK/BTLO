BTLO Investigation Notes – CVE Identification and Hidden URIs

To find URIs that could reveal internal structures or access points not meant for public users, I added /robots.txt to the base URL of the site. 
This file is commonly used to instruct search engines on which paths to ignore, but it can also unintentionally disclose sensitive or restricted paths.

In this case, the robots.txt file revealed two disallowed URIs:

/admin
/admin/file-upload

Testing these in the browser led to login pages, confirming that they are valid endpoints. While access is restricted, their existence provides useful 
information for reconnaissance and may indicate administrative functionality that could be targeted further.

For the CVE identification, the application was running Next.js version 15.0.0. I searched across vulnerability databases including NVD and CVE.org using 
terms like "Next.js 15" and reviewed CVEs specific to that version. After filtering through unrelated results, I identified CVE-2025-29927 as the most relevant match.

This vulnerability impacts versions starting from 1.11.4 up to, but not including, versions 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3. It allows an attacker to bypass 
authorization checks if those checks are implemented in middleware. The advisory recommends upgrading to a safe version or filtering out external requests with the 
x-middleware-subrequest header as a mitigation.

Today I successfully identified two URIs likely intended to be hidden from general access, verified their existence, and confirmed a CVE that matches the application’s 
version and the nature of the exploit being simulated in the lab.
