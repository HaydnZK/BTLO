To determine the unique URI accessed by the attacker post-exploitation, I first focused on identifying signs of the CVE being used.
The site was running Next.js 15.0.0, and I found CVE-2025-29927, which allows attackers to bypass authorization by abusing middleware.

I searched the SIEM logs for any signs of middleware activity and found the HTTP header x-middleware-subrequest being used in several 
requests. This confirmed the CVE was likely being exploited.

From there, I checked the nearby log entries and found a specific URI that was accessed shortly afterward. It wasnâ€™t commonly visited and 
stood out from regular traffic, which made it the most likely target accessed after the breach.

To find this, I used the search:

index=* "x-middleware-subrequest"
